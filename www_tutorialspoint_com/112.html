<h2>Revenue Sharing and Payments</h2>\r
<p>When an instructor or a publisher hosts a course or an eBook on our website and we sell that course or eBook to our students, the revenue generated by the paid courses will have 45% revenue share for the company and the remaining 55% revenue will be shared with the instructor or the publisher.</p>\r
<p>If a student purchases a course or an eBook in India, then it requires us to remit sales taxes, good and service tax (GST), or other similar transaction taxes ("Transaction Taxes"), under applicable law, we will collect and remit those Transaction Taxes to the competent tax authorities for those sales. If the student purchases the course from outside India through Paypal, GST is not applicable, but paypal gateway charges would be applicable.</p>\r
<p>When a student purchases a course, we calculate the gross amount of the sale as the amount actually received by Tutorials Point from the student ("Sale Amount"). From this, the applicable taxes and payment gateway transaction charges are deducted to calculate the net amount of the sale ("Net Amount").</p>\r
<p>If we make a sell through our any of our affiliates, we calculate the gross amount of the sale as the amount actually received by Tutorials Point from the student ("Sale Amount"). From this, the applicable affiliate commission, taxes and payment gateway transaction charges are deducted to calculate the net amount of the sale ("Net Amount").</p>\r
<p>Your revenue share will be 55% of the Net Amount.  Tutor or Publisher residing in India will have to furnish PAN card details for TDS deduction of 10% as per government norms. For Tutor or Publisher based outside India, TDS will not be deducted from your revenue share.</p> \r
<p>We process the payments in the first week of every month. Any sell becomes mature after its 30 days guarantee period is over. Once a sell is matured, we credit the payments of that sell in the first week of the subsequent month. We reserve the right not to pay out funds in the event of identified fraud, violations of intellectual property rights, or other violations of the law.</p>\r
<p>We have the following two methods to remit your payments based on your locality:</p>\r
<ul class="list">\r
<li><p>If you are an instructor/publisher residing in India, we remit your payments directly in your bank account through online bank transaction. To process your payments, we will require your bank account details such as account number, account holder\xe2\x80\x99s name, bank name, branch name, and IFSC code.</p></li>\r
<li><p>For instructors/publishers who reside outside India, we disburse the payments in U.S. dollars (USD), through PayPal, regardless of the currency with which the sale was made. You must own a PayPal account and keep us informed of the correct email associated with your account, in order for us to release your payments in a timely manner. We will assume transaction processing fees excluding foreign currency conversion fees. Your revenue report will show the sales price in Indian Rupees (INR) and your converted revenue amount in US Dollar (USD).</p></li>\r
</ul>\r
<p>If required by the government agencies, we may demand any tax or other related documents from you. We reserve the right to withhold payments or impose other penalties if we do not receive proper identifying information or any other related documentation from you.</p>\r
<p>You understand and agree that you are ultimately responsible for any applicable taxes on your income to your local authorities.</p>\r
